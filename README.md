<h2>SQL Project 3</h2>
The Manager’s Meetings have just concluded, and the Regional Director of Sales would like to get a list of all customers and when their accounts were opened. They prefer to see the list where the month, the day, the quarter, and the year the account was opened listed separately for each customer. However, they would still like to see the original account opening date. They would also like to see the list ordered by the most recent year, followed by the quarter.
